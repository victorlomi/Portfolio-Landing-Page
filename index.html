        <p class="section-text">I am a recent highschool graduate who enjoys everything tech. I will be going to university next year to further my studies in Computer Science. Hopefully, with the help of this program at Moringa School. I will be better prepared for the programming I will be doing at University. I also hope that I can learn programming languages used in the real world because I want to apply what I learn towards making my own applications. And that these applications I make use best practices in the industy.</p>
